        "description": "<div><p>In terms of health care, governments face a number of challenges, including lack of funds and poor infrastructure. This is compounded by epidemics, poverty and the brain drain of homegrown doctors moving abroad, in search of higher wages and a better standard of living. Varying wildly from country to country and region to region, public health care does exist but most expats will want to use the private sector (often based in large cities and major tourist locations) or have the international health insurance and funds to be evacuated to another country.</p><p>While Nigeria has a public health service financed through a national insurance scheme, newcomers to the country might want to consider their own private medical insurance, use private health care facilities, and make sure they are covered for repatriation (in the event of death) or medical evacuation to another better-equipped country, if necessary. Public health care is improving, but it faces a number of difficulties including a low ratio of doctors at only 1 per 2,000 inhabitants (low on a global scale but higher than most of its African neighbours) and an infrastructure struggling to cope.</p><p>Foreign nationals seeking to live and work in Zimbabwe might want to ensure they have adequate private medical insurance to cover private treatment and evacuation to somewhere with additional facilities, if necessary. The availability of staff, beds, technology, and pharmaceuticals is unreliable in hospitals and, although the government has promised to improve the health of the nation as a whole, many foreign nationals will find that provision is underfunded and varies in standard. Have access to enough cash to cover emergency care, as many private clinics will not treat patients until they have paid up front. With just 1 doctor per 10,000 people the country’s health care system is ranked as 155th out of 191 in the world by the World Health Organization</p></div>",
