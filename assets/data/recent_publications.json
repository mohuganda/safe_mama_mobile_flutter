        "description": "\u003Cp\u003EPreface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nEswatini has made significant strides towards achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets set for 2025. This is evidenced by preliminary data\r\nfrom SHIMS3, which reported that 94% of adults 15 years and older living with HIV are aware of their status, 97% of those aware of their\r\nstatus are on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 96% of those on ART have achieved viral suppression. However, further analysis of HIV data\r\nshows that there are sub-population differences. To close these gaps, the country needs to scale up provision of prevention services among\r\nthose at risk, and ensure timely treatment for those lagging sub-populations. It is therefore important to prioritise key populations, males,\r\nespecially young men as well as adolescents and young children to be retained in care, if the country is to maintain the gains attained so far.\r\nA significant proportion of deaths among PLHIV are from non-AIDS-related causes, hence the need to provide integrated services. These\r\nguidelines address innovations like HIV self-testing (HIVST), Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, package of care for clients\r\nwith advanced immunodeficiency and the introduction of newer drugs formulations and new differentiated service delivery (DSD) models.\r\nWith the introduction of new drugs, emphasis has also been made on strengthening pharmacovigilance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nThe emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has also emphasised the need for integrated services and ensuring patient-centred care. HIV\r\nservice delivery has been decentralised in to the community and psychosocial interventions have been introduced as a means to retain\r\npatients in care particularly in adolescents and in those re-engaging into care. The country has been and continues to integrate other services\r\ninto the HIV program. Of note, sexual and reproductive health services have been successfully integrated into most health facilities with\r\ncontraception and cervical cancer screening being offered within ART clinics. To increase the uptake of HIV services among the male\r\npopulation, voluntary male circumcision is also offered in selected health facilities, some of which have opened male-centred clinics.\r\nIntegration of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) management especially diabetes mellitus and hypertension screening and treatment are\r\ncurrently ongoing within the country. Due to the effect of HIV on the outcome of COVID-19 coinfection, vaccination is also being encouraged\r\nand promoted among all PLHIV.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the global economic climate changes coupled with the country’s steps towards achieving epidemic control, it is very important to ensure\r\nthat the gains attained so far are maintained and sustained. This requires a clear understanding of donor-funded programs and intervention\r\ncomponents that are critical for the country to achieve and sustain epidemic control and how these components can be transitioned to the\r\ngovernment if not already within government structures. Additionally, healthcare workers across all cadres should maintain to date\r\nunderstanding of these innovative approaches, incorporating them into daily practice.\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese guidelines provide the standards and recommendations for the Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini’s vision of ending AIDS as a\r\npublic health threat. To achieve this vision, we need a continued concerted effort from all stakeholders at all levels of service delivery to\r\ntranslate these guidelines into action. Meaningful engagement of recipients of care from the constituency of PLHIV at all levels of care is vital\r\nin achieving this goal.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",

The International\r\nBank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has agreed to provide financing for the Project.\r\n2.

In such circumstances,\r\nthe Recipient will agree to the changes with the Association and will update the ESCP to reflect such\r\nchanges. Agreement on changes to the ESCP will be documented through the exchange of letters signed\r\nbetween the Association and the Recipient. The Recipient will promptly disclose the updated ESCP.\r\n6.

        "description": "\u003Cp\u003ENHSSP II (2014-2018) ensures that a comprehensive set of health services is provided as a holistic response\r\nto the health needs of the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland. The plan is built around a functional rather\r\nthan structural approach, with various interlocking elements that all work towards a common health\r\nagenda. NHSSP II draws on the Swaziland Development Index (SDI), the National Development Strategy\r\n(1999), and the National Health Policy (2007), which are informed by global and countrywide health\r\naspirations. It constitutes the medium-term strategic focus for the health sector. The plan involves\r\naddressing health-seeking behaviours and health actions in other sectors, in addition to the traditional\r\npublic health and curative services. A stronger element of client-focused and client-centered health\r\nservices has been introduced into the plan, as well as a comprehensive and rationalized health systems\r\ninvestment focus which ensures that all the critical investment needs of the health sector are addressed.\r\nFurthermore, it focuses more on strengthening the regulation of health service provision.\r\nNHSSP design is based on the need to attain equity of access to health and related services as defined in\r\nthe Essential Health Care Package (EHCP). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis implies that health sector activities during this period shall\r\nfocus on:\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eincreasing the number of health and related services and interventions provided across the\r\ncountry (introduction of interventions as and where needed);\r\n\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eexpanding population coverage by the various health and related services and interventions\r\n(scale-up of intervention use); and\r\n\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ereducing the household financial burden incurred at the point of access and in the use of health\r\nand related services and interventions (reduce catastrophic health expenditures).\r\nN\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHSSP II has seven interlinked chapters as follows:\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Chapter 1 provides background information on the overall strategic plan – indicating where the\r\nfocus and priorities lie;\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb) Chapter 2 describes the overall strategic direction and focus of NHSSP II;\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) Chapter 3 defines the health services that the health sector intends to make available to the people\r\nin the Kingdom of Swaziland;\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) Chapter 4 elaborates on the health investments needed to ensure provision of the services outlined\r\nin chapter 3;\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) Chapter 5 focuses on the financing measures that ensure progress towards the attainment of\r\nuniversal access;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\r\nf) Chapter 6 highlights the key implementation arrangements that the sector will use to ensure the\r\nattainment of targets for the health services and investments; and\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eg) Chapter 7 defines the monitoring/evaluation process for ensuring that NHSSP II implementation\r\nproceeds as planned.\u003C/p\u003E",
